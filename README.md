# Randomized Algorithms

I'm working through *Randomized Algorithms* by Rajeev Motwani and Prabhakar Raghavan. 

I'm going to try implementing each algorithms in Python and explaining my thoughts on each algorithm in the comments. 

## NOTE:
I might also double back adn implement the algorithms in C too. Who knows?
