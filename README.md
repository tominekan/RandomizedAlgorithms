# Randomized Algorithms

I'm working through *Randomized Algorithms* by Rajeev Motwani and Prabhakar Raghavan. 

I'm going to try implementing each algorithms in Python and explaining my thoughts on each algorithm in the comments. 


## Note:
I think in order to build my understanding of programming, I might to be switching the algorithms I implement to C.
